      <p>
        The only real way to KNOW the PURE and HOLY JOY of Tito Tino's AVOCADOS is to bring Yourself into the blessed land of Tito Tino's avocado farm. Sure, you could go to the store and BUY an AVOCADO, but avocados that have not been raised with LOVE and TRUTH can never compare to Tito Tino's AVOCADOS. <br />
        <br />
        Avoca-"do" Yourself a favor and visit the farmland itself. Tito Tino has lovingly prepared the Earth with his SACRED KNOWLEDGE of the TRUTH from the UNIVERSE, and knows the exact formula of sunlight, earth, water, and LOVE to grow happy, pure AVOCADOS that represent the JOY and BOUNTY that the UNIVERSE has to offer. <br />
        <br />
        So come. Summon the BIRD of KNOWLEDGE. Wander into the desert. Follow the LIGHT and ENERGY of the UNIVERSE until you find TRUTH.... and Tito Tino's Avocados.
